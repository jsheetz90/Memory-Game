# Memory-Game
This is a command-line based Memory Game. 
You can play it by downloading `Cards.py` and `Game.py` and running `Game.py` from the command line using something like `python3 game.py`

The goal of the game is to match up all of the cards. You play by entering the space number you want to select, then selecting another space. For example, you can select `A2` and then `B3` and see if they match. If not, keep trying until you get all of the spaces matched up.
